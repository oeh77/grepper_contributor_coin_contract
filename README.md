The purpose of GREPCC is to provide a tangible reward as an incentive for developers to contribute answers, feedback, engagement and content to the Grepper community.
 “Grepper Contributor Coin (GREPCC)” is a social token built on the Solana blockchain. 

## How GREPCC Is Distributed

GREPCC is distributed to Grepper Contributors through two broad means: User Tips & Top Quality Answers.   

### Top Quality Answers
Coins will be minted on a daily basis, to users who have contributed helpful answers/content to Grepper. Initially 1 GREPCC will be issued per answer per day for answers that rank in the top 30% quality score.  Additionally, in order to prevent spam answers, for  “bad answers” (answers that have a quality score in the bottom 20% of answers) 1 GREPCC will be deducted from that day's earnings. 

Ex: Sally has inputted 20 Grepper answers, 10 of which have a quality score that fall within the top 30% of answers and 2 of which fall within the bottom 20% of answers. Sally will earn 8 newly minted GREPCC per day.  If Sally sets the 2 bad answers to private or deletes them, then those answers will not be deducted from her earnings, so she will earn 10 GREPCC a day.  Users can’t earn negative coins daily, so if a user only has 2 answers and they are both bad, they will simply earn 0 GREPCC a day. 

**Good Answers (Top 30%)**: At present in order to be in the top 30% an answer must have a quality score of .93 or about ~1. This number should increase slightly as the quality score of all answers increase. 

**Bad Answers (Bottom 20%)**: At present this number is a quality score of less than ~0. This number should increase slightly as the quality score of all answers increase. 

**Quality Score**: The thrust of an answers “quality score” is to get a number on how “helpful” an answer is to other developers, this is a little tricky and may be adjusted in order to better capture “helpfulness”. At present an answer's “quality score” is calculated based on a weighted number of upvotes, downvotes and copies it gets relative to views . Quality Score = (upvotes*upvoteWeight) + (copies*copyWeight) - (downvotes*downvoteWeight ) / (views)
